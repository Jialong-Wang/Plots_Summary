Notes:
1. The initial optimized geometries for reacants (R), transition states (TS), and products (P) are obtained from Ref 1. 
2. PF codes have been modified based on the work of author Braden from Reference 2.
3. Example files can be found in the TD_R directory; the name and corresponding coordinates can be changed to TS or P as needed.
4. Within the TD_R directory, modify the polarization vectors in the input section of the Python codes to achieve the desired directions (X-, Y-, Z-polarizations or specific theta/phi angles).
