Title: Investigating Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics-Enabled Endo/Exo- Selectivities in a Diels-Alder Reaction

ChemRxiv

Abstract:

Contact Information: bweight@ur.rochester.edu

Notes:
1. The initial optimized geometries for reacants (R), transition states (TS), and products (P) are obtained from Ref 1. 
2. PF codes are modified based on the work of author Braden from Ref 2.
3. Example files are shown in TD_R directory (can change the name & corresponding coordinates to TS, P)
4. Inside TD_R directory, modify polarization vectors in the input section (X-, Y- , Z- polarizations or sepcific theta/phi angles)
